Abstract
======
Pose graph optimization (PGO) methods are extensively used in robotic inspection (RI) to estimate accurate 3D scanner poses. However, some inaccurate
pairwise relative measurements decrease the accuracy of PGO. To achieve a robust and accurate RI, we propose a new framework called robust constrained pose graph optimization (RCPGO). Specifically, we introduce some additional landmarks to construct a constrained pose graph (CPG) and improve the accuracy of PGO by CPGâ€™s spatial geometry consistency. Furthermore, the symmetric (SYMM) distance function is introduced to construct the objective function of RCPGO, which has a higher D-optimality design metric upper bound and contributes to the robustness and accuracy of RCPGO. To solve the SYMM-RCPGO problem in SE<sub>3</sub><sup>N</sup>, we linearize the problem into sequential quadratic programming (SQP) and solve the perturbation of SE<sub>3</sub><sup>N</sup> by the interior-point method. Moreover, a dynamic constraints boundaries algorithm is proposed to prevent inaccurate linearization caused by large perturbation. To assess the effectiveness of SYMM-RCPGO, we conducted comparative evaluations with traditional PGO in both simulated cylinder surfaces and real high-speed train scenes. The results validate the robustness and accuracy of SYMM-RCPGO and find that a few constraints can significantly reduce pose error. Our source code and data are available at [https://github.com/Timbersaw-wangzw/SYMM_RCPGO.git](https://github.com/Timbersaw-wangzw/SYMM_RCPGO.git).
